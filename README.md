# House_price_prediction
To study the performance of liner regression against the house of prices situated in various localities in bengaluru  and also to predict a optimal price for a home based on the dataset from the derived model.The regression algorithms used in this study are multiple linear it is used to find correlation between various unique home and their features.The test is performed after applying the required pre-processing methods and splitting the data into two parts. However, one part will be used in the training and the other in the test phase.The data used in the experiment will be handled by using a combination of pre-processing methods to improve the prediction accuracy. The given datasets should be processed to enhance performance, which is accomplished by identifying the necessary features by applying one of the selection methods to eliminate the unwanted variables since each house has its unique features that help to estimate its price. These features may or may not be shared with all houses, which means they do not have the same influence on the house pricing resulting in inaccurate output.
